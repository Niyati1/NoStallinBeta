    <string name="faq"><b>What does this app do? </b>No Stallin exclusively helps you learn if there is a stall with a door in a Men’s rooms at locations with user generated data. No Stallin does not assess safety of any restroom. It is based on your input – built up and maintained by you. \n \n <b>Why make this app?</b>  The idea for this app came out of the Trans Experience Study (TEST) in which 65 trans masculine men were interviewed about challenges they faced during their transition. Many (understandably) described how stressful they found using gender-specific  public men’s rooms to be. We want to help. \n \n <b>Why Only Men’s Rooms?</b>  Many public Men’s rooms don’t have stalls with working doors in them. Many have urinals against the wall and then a toilet in a corner with a wall barrier but no stall with a door.  If you do not, or cannot, use a urinal, this can mean there is no place for you to go to the bathroom. For those who use women’s rooms – stall doors tend not to be the issue. \n \n <b>Why not use Restroom Refuge?</b> DO use Restroom Refuge! Restroom Refuge can help you find a safe, single-use gender neutral restroom! But it can’t help you find out if there is a stall with a door in a men’s room that is for multi-person use. \n \n <b>So this app is only for trans men?</b> Nope. Of course not silly. This app is for anyone who has the pleasure of using men’s rooms. Have fun. Everyone needs to use a bathroom. This app is a tool to help anyone who uses Men’s rooms. Either help plan ahead BEFORE you are there or reporting to the global Men’s bathroom using community where a quiet stall can be found! </string>
